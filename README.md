# hello-world
first repository

I really didn't understand get-hub but heard the word used in casual convos. I just pretended I knew what that is. Now, I have an opportunity to figure it out with the really really awesome "hello-world" with some easy to follow steps. Once this is done, I will not need to pretend anymore!
